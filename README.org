* twitch-rss

returns a RSS feed from a Twitch category. Intented to be use with newsboat.

** Usage

*** Credentials

Place the =twitch-rss= binary on the same folder than a file called =twitch-rss.secret= that has your own:

- <Client ID> on the first line
- <Client Secret> on the second line

See [[https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication#registration][Twitch API Documentation]] to obtain them

*** Execution

This will return 20 entries from the category "Software and Game Development"

#+begin_src
$ ./twitch-rss -n 20 "Software and Game Development"
#+end_src

*** Filtering

I personally filter out entries on my RSS reader. On *newsboat* I added something like this to only get streams from =lisp= and =golang=:

#+begin_src
ignore-mode    "download"
ignore-article "exec:~/.newsboat/feeds/twitch-rss -n 50 'Software and Game Development'" "title !~ \"lisp\" and title !~ \"golang\""
#+end_src
